## Freestar Home Assestment

The solution provides the necessary code for the Blackjack Card Game Challenge.
Actually there are no external assets to load images nor svgs to render Cards.
Also, this solution could be solved in many different ways having different considerations, but this is a minimalistic approach following the Keep it simple principle for the sake of simplicity - other approaches can be discussed, like having render Components and View Pages -
Another aspect not covered here is the use of Typescript which I avoid to use just to be aligned with the expectations of vanilla javascript.
