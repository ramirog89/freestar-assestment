Engineering Hiring Challenge

Title: Blackjack Card Game Challenge
Duration: 1 Week

Instructions
You are tasked with implementing the classic card game Blackjack (21 or Pontoon) using JavaScript. The goal is to test your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and ability to create clean and maintainable code.

Task
Create a Blackjack card game that adheres to the following rules:
Blackjack hands are scored by their point total.
The hand with the highest total wins if it doesn't exceed 21. A hand with a higher total than 21 is considered a bust.
Cards numbered 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
Face cards (jack, queen, king) are each worth 10 points.
An ace can be worth 11 points if it doesn't cause the player to bust. If it would cause a bust, it is worth 1 point.

Requirements
Create a simple user interface (UI) and a service to support the game. The UI should allow the player to:
Start a new game.
See their current hand and point total.
Draw additional cards (Hit) or end their turn (Stand).
Display the dealer's hand, keeping one card hidden (the hold card).
Announce the winner (player or dealer) at the end of the game.
Create clean and maintainable code focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Submission
Create your own GitHub repository for this challenge.
Commit your code to the repository, including all necessary files.
Write a README.md file documenting a runbook for the application and any steps for building and/or testing the application.
Share the link to your GitHub repository with the contact information provided.

Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
Adherence to the game rules and requirements.
User interface functionality and usability.
Code quality, organization, and maintainability.
Correct implementation of game logic and scoring.
Proper use of OOP principles.

Good luck, and happy coding!
